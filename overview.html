        The Netaji Subhash Engineering College (NSEC) has been set up, keeping in mind the ideals of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, whose contribution to the Indian Freedom Movement remains invaluable forever. Netaji had dreamt of vibrant, strong and powerful India, an India which would be independent and self reliant, not only politically, but also in the spheres of Education & Technology. He strongly believed that true independence can only stem from strong base in education and technology.<br><br>

        His vision is our beacon and to give a concrete shape to his vision, we have set up Netaji Subhash Engineering College. We believe in his ideals that intelligent minds are the greatest resources in any walk of life. Our vision is to infuse young intelligent minds with cutting edge technical education and help them to become matured professionals poised and ready to accept technical and managerial challenges in the global scenario.<br><br>

        At NSEC, we give maximum importance to in-depth studies in IT and its related fields. Without diluting this basic goal and with an aim to produce professionals with sound knowledge in IT., we also intend to further sharpen our students by imparting specialized training in different advanced topics in management and technology so that our outgoing students can become not mere professionals knowledgeable in TI, but technically and managerially confident professionals with good communication skills - a more matured and better marketable product.<br><br>

        Apart from 4 years B.Tech the Institute also offers 2 years Masters of Technology Programmes and 3 years Masters Programme leading to MCA, approved by Department of Higher Education, Govt. of West Bengal and All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Ministry of Human Resource Development, Govt. of India and affiliated to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, West Bengal (Formerly known as West Bengal University of Technology - WBUT).<br><br>
