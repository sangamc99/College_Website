    <h3>MENTORING SYSTEM</h3>
    <p id="mentor">
    	Preamble: During their four years’ journey through the under graduate engineering programme students often need mentoring, guidance and counselling from a loving elderly figure. Direct academic issues e.g. selection of electives can be easily communicated to the student. But finer nuances e.g. career options or fear of a subject/course need greater involvement of the mentor. Obviously, a student should have the same mentor all through the four years of his journey.<br>
    		A similar system as discussed above, namely ‘Faculty Advisor’ exists in this college since 2005. To improve the institute’s present endeavour towards academic quality up gradation in line with NBA guidelines, it has become necessary to redefine/reform the existing system. The new system, when practiced diligently will immensely contribute in improvement of the overall academic quality. The students will be greatly benefited by continuous expert guidance.<br>
    	Mentoring System: The new process has been established as ‘Mentoring System’. Each faculty will be the mentor of a group of 20 to 25 students. First year students will have mentors from the department of Basic Engineering & Science and second, third, fourth year students will have mentors from the parent department. Departmental faculties will continue to be mentors for the same group of students till their graduation.<br>

    	Responsibilities: The mentor will perform the following functions. The list of course cannot be exclusive. A mentor can always do more for the benefit of the students.<br>

		1.Meet the group of students at least twice a month.<br>
		2.Continuously monitor, counsel, guide and motivate the students in all academic matters.<br>
		3.Advise students regarding choice of electives, project, summer training etc.<br>
		4.Contact parents/guardians if situation demands e.g. academic irregularities, negative behavioral changes and interpersonal relations, detrimental activities etc.<br>
		5.Advise students in their career development/professional guidance.<br>
		6.Keep contact with the students even after their graduation.<br>
		7.Intimate HOD and suggest if any administrative action is called for.<br>
		8.Maintain a detail progressive record of the student (format attached).<br>
		9.Maintain a brief but clear record of all discussions with students.<br>
